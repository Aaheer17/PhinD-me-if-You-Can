This repository contains a Streamlit prototype application.  
Follow the steps below to install everything and run the `app.py` file.

---

## 1. Install Python

Make sure you have **Python 3.8 or higher** installed.

Check your Python version:

```bash
python3 --version
```

---

## 2. (Optional but recommended) Create a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows:

```powershell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\Activate
```

---

## 3. Install required packages

Inside the project folder, run:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas
```

These are the only required dependencies.

---

## 4. Run the Streamlit application

Run this from the same directory where `app.py` is located:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Streamlit will start the app and display a link such as:

```
Local URL: http://localhost:8501
```

Open that link in your browser to use the app.
