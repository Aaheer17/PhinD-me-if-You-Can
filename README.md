# PhinD me if You Can 🎓  
_Find your perfect PhD advisor match_

This repository contains a Streamlit prototype app that helps prospective PhD students explore how well they might match with a potential advisor, based on:

- Student’s research interests, skills, preferences, CV, and SOP  
- Professor’s Google Scholar and lab website  
- Precomputed LLM-based analyses stored as JSON files

The app is designed for the **Claude for Good 2025 – Student Track**.
